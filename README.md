## About

AccountLite Desktop is a lightweight accounting software with recording financial transactions (no inventory management available), classification(ledgers), and summarization(trial balance). The data is stored in a human readable format (which is very similar to CSV).

## Getting Started
### As User
Download the `accountlite.exe` binary executable file from the latest [release](https://github.com/captainAyan/accountlite-desktop/releases/latest)
